I am a final year bioengineering student at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. I am passionate about designing cutting-edge solutions to outstanding problems in biomedical engineering, medicine and beyond.

Currently, I am a research assistant at the Surgical Performance Enhancement and Robotics (SuPER) center at the McGill University Health Center (MUHC) under the supervision of Professor Amir Hooshiar. My focus is on developing next-generation soft robotic surgical systems which enable and expand surgical access to hard to reach areas of the body.

While my undergraduate research has thus far focused on surgical robotics, the skills that I have acquired can span many other engineering disciplines. I consider myself to be a lifelong learner who strives to learn new and interesting ways of tackling real-world problems.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy badminton games with friends, long walks with my dog, cycling and cooking.
